Time Bank is a software where time is stored instead of money.
Users registered there can use their earned time for learning new skills. Also, users can save time by teaching skills to others.

Here, time is the currency. A user can both teach and learn skills without paying a single penny by just using their saved time and used time.

Teaching -> Earn time
Learning -> Deduct(Use) time.

For Example :-
Suppose, a user taught 'playing guitar' to someone for 15 mins, then he/she earned 15 minutes which is stored in his profile. Now, he/she can use that time for learning skills he want.

Where we use technologies:-

1. Using ReactJS on frontend
2. For state management, Redux and middleware Saga
3. Using Storybook.js for Components testing
4. Zoom for online teaching
5. MongoDB as a Database
6. Express to make server

Frontend will be deployed on Netlify
Backend will be deployed on Heroku
