Time Bank is a software where time is stored instead of money.
Users registered there can use their earned time for learning new skills. Also, users can save time by teaching skills to others.

Here, time is the currency. A user can both teach and learn skills without paying a single penny by just using their saved time and used time.

Teaching -> Earn time
Learning -> Deduct(Use) time.

For Example :-
Suppose, a user taught 'playing guitar' to someone for 15 mins, then he/she earned 15 minutes which is stored in his profile. Now, he/she can use that time for learning skills he want.

Where we use technologies:-

1. Using ReactJS on frontend
2. For state management, Redux and middleware Saga
3. Using Storybook.js for Components testing
4. Zoom for online teaching
5. MongoDB as a Database
6. Express to make server

Frontend will be deployed on Netlify
Backend will be deployed on Heroku

Synopsis:

INTRODUCTION

Time Bank is a website where time is used as a means of exchange instead of money
to learn new things.
Registered users can earn time by teaching skills to other people and can use that
earned time to learn new skills for themselves.
Here, time is the currency.
Every user will get sign up bonus minutes in his/her time bank account. He/she could
earn more by teaching skills or can use them to learn new skills. However, if a user's
minutes balanced is completely used up and he/she is unable to earn more, then there
is no worry for that. We will be giving limited bonus minutes to every user every
week.
The main objective of the this website is to promote one on one learning. Now-a-days
there are a lot of courses available on the internet but it is hard to find good intructor
to get one on one learning.
By using this website users can learn through one on one learning.
In this project we are working in a team of five people: Abhishek, Shivam(TL),
Akarsh, Divyanshu, Utkarsh.
We will be using MERN stack for this project. The goal would to be make the UI as
user-friendly as it can be.

USE OF THE PROJECT

As the project introduction gives you brief detail about this product,
here are some uses about this project:-

Feasibility of Project

1) Time Bank can be used by the students, teachers and employees, etc because here
we focus on learning skills and this is most important part of life to become successful.
2) In today’s time companies focus a lot on skills rather than the background while
recruiting. So, in near time our project will create more impact and boom because we
will provide all type of skills(courses) in exchange of time only.
3) Practically, if we want to learn a skill then we have to go some online courses site
like udemy, coursera, etc but they provide course in huge amount but here we have
concept of time exchange.
4) Usually, people can use this in part time or weekends along with there jobs. This
will encourage many more to learn skills in their free times because they don’t have to
pay for that.
